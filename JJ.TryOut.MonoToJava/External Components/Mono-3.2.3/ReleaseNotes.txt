By The Mono Team <mono@novell.com> Sep 15, 2013
Based on the work of Francisco G. Martinez  (Paco)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check http://go-mono.com/archive/3.2.3/ for release details.

General Description:

This installation includes Mono 3.2.3  for Windows and the 
Gtk# 1.0.10 and 2.12.11 for Windows.  It also includes a 
built and configured version of XSP.

Installer Changes:

1.2.x:
 -Library version updates: 
   glib -> 2.12.3
   gtk -> 2.10.3
   gnome -> 2.16
   libglade -> 2.6
   glade -> 3
 -Removed mono-tools since it depends on gtkhtml-sharp2, which has 
  not been shipped on win32 yet

1.1.13.4:
 -removed wimp theme, as it comes with gtk+ named as MS-Windows

1.1.13.2-1:
 -Upgraded to GTK+ 2.8 and most Gnome 2.12 deps are included
 -Upgraded to gtk# 2.8
 -Upgraded Glade to 2.10 (Downloaded zip was labeled 2.12.1...?)
 -MonoDoc browser is included
  -gnome-sharp for gtk-sharp 1.0 have been added
  -Many Gnome Deps were required for this.  So, until we have gecko-sharp
   working in the installer, this is the way it goes.  Including Gnome deps
   add around 40MB uncompressed to the installed files.
 -Copied files in place of symbolic links for monodoc, gecko-sharp and boo
 -Got the samples working with the current gtk-sharp (Bug #77292)
 -sqlsharpgtk now uses the Mono App Guidelines for its file locations
  -Had to recompile for some unknown reason...

1.1.10.1:
 -InnoSetup shell/batch file substitution has been cleaned up.
 -Remove some unnecessary dll maps from the mono config file.
 -Add libz development files.
1.1.10:
 -gtk-wimp theme now the default.  The old Default theme was renamed to
 'Raleigh'.

Requirements:

- This build runs on Windows 2000 or later.

Known Issues:
-Uploading changes in Monodoc causes a crash.  Still looking into this.
-Generating the index in Monodoc causes an exception (chmod error)
 but the index eventually gets generated
-Icon View in GtkDemo crashes because of some missing themes (tried adding
 themes, but the problem still occurs)
