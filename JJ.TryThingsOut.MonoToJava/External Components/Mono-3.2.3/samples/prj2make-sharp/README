README for Mono prj2make#
-------------------------------------------

This is a GTK# application that runs on Linux and Windows (if
configured with GTK#).  The app can read a solution file 
produced with Visual Studio .NET and later can generate a 
makefile suitable for compilation with csc.exe.

Today it does both *.sln and *.cmbx in both Windows 
(nmake.exe) and *NIX (gmake).  The user can choose between
makefile output that uses mcs.exe -- preferred :D -- or
csc.exe.

The first objective is to handle the creation of solution
files and all subprojects (*.csproj) they may contain.  It
should do it for msc and csc.

Next, I want to tackle combines form #Develop/MonoDevelop. 
Same specifics as above with the corresponding targets and
appropriate conventions. 

Finally, I want to be able to do conversions from sln to
cmbx and maybe, vice versa.
