RELEASE NOTES for Prj2Make-Sharp ver 0.95 - Sunday, June 20, 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  prj2make-sharp version 0.95 code name 'Moi'. This release fixes problem with 
the generation of MonoDevelop solutions and project files when these are generated
from MS Visual Studio .NET solutions using the prj2make-sharp input parameter
--csproj2prjx. If you are using MonoDevelop release 0.4 you would probably want to
use this new version of prj2make-sharp.

This release was built and tested with Mono Beta 3 but, should work with Mono 
Beta 2.

Note: Once MonoDevelop release 0.5 becomes available you may resume importing 
projects using the facilities available within the IDE.
