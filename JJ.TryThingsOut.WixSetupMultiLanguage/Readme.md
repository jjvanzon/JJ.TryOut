=====================================

Trying to follow this how-to in hope to create a single multi-lingual .msi setup file that would adapt to the operating system's language for the languages are supported by the msi.

I tried and it did not work on my Windows 7 Ultimate set to Dutch. I tried more and more things, trying to understanding it more and more. I could not get it to work. The installer seems it has both languages in it: English and Dutch. I can start the resulting msi in Dutch when I use some extra command line parameters, but it does not seem to adapt to the OS's language automatically.
